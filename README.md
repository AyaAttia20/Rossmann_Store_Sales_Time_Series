# 🏪🛒 Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting

This project tackles the **Rossmann Store Sales** time series forecasting problem using a mix of statistical and machine learning models.

## 🧩 Problem Description

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores across Europe. The goal is to forecast daily sales for each store based on historical sales data, promotions, holidays, and other features.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this notebook, I build a complete forecasting pipeline that includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Baseline model (Naive)
- Time series models (ETS, ARIMA, Prophet)
- Machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost)
- Evaluation using **RMSPE** (Root Mean Square Percentage Error)
